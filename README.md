## About The Project
Through this web application you can find articles on specific topics of interest.

You enter a word in the search and the site shows a maximum of 10 articles related to it.
Every article is presented with a short insight, e.g
* headline,
* the lead paragraph,
* news desk,
* word count etc;

With [Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview), the app pulls information about articles from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/). Thanks to it we can be sure that all the information that is pulled is relatively fresh.

The link to the original Web Resourse is also provided.

## Note for the mentor

All post-deadline changes are made to design the ReadMe.md and fix the errors that were made due to me remaking the project for 3rd time in a row and not creating a new repo to ease my life
